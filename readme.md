# CIFAR-10 Dataset Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images, divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset comprises 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is widely recognized for its use in training and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in the field of computer vision.

## Dataset Description

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a benchmark dataset used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes include:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
